\section{Profile}
Self-motivated, calm and confident under pressure, I always strive to achieve the best I can, as demonstrated accumulating in the same year four A-Levels and an Extended Project Qualification on Blockchain Technology. I also work well in a team: gaining top grade in my first year for a group project in C in which we created a neural network that would predict stock prices along with a genetic algorithm to conÔ¨Ågure the hyper-parameters of the network for optimum performance. \newline
Multicultural background and innate interest in people motivate my participation in charity work.
